	•	No-code builders: Free plans of WordPress.com (with ads on a *.wordpress.com subdomain) ￼, Wix or Weebly (both have limited free tiers), and Google Sites (free with a Google account) let you build basic sites without coding. Carrd.co offers a free plan (up to 3 one-page sites) for landing pages or simple sites ￼. Google Sites (free) or Mobirise (free offline builder) can also be used.
	•	Static site generators (free): Tools like Jekyll, Hugo or Eleventy (open-source) can be used with the above hosts for full control. No hosting costs beyond the free tiers above.

</html>

How it works: This static HTML uses responsive <meta> and flexbox CSS to look good on mobile and desktop. The “Buy on Gumroad” buttons link to your Gumroad products (Gumroad’s free plan handles payment). The Calendly widget (using Calendly’s free embedding) lets clients pick times ￼. The YouTube and TikTok sections show embedded videos. The “Recommended Gear” cards link to affiliate programs (Amazon, CJ, etc.) via your affiliate IDs. All images and links use free services; no paid scripts are needed. You can upload this index.html (and your images) directly to GitHub Pages or any static host.

3. Deploying Your Website for Free

To go live with zero cost, use a free hosting service for static sites:
	•	GitHub Pages (Free): Push your code to a public GitHub repo named username.github.io. GitHub Pages will automatically serve index.html at https://username.github.io ￼. (Create a new repo, enable Pages in Settings, or follow GitHub’s quickstart ￼.) This has no fees and supports custom domains via Cloudflare if desired.
	•	Netlify or Vercel (Free tiers): Connect your GitHub repo to Netlify or Vercel. They auto-deploy on commit and give a free .netlify.app or .vercel.app URL. Both allow custom domains and SSL at no cost.
	•	Cloudflare Pages: Similar to Netlify, with free Git integration and global CDN.
	•	WordPress.com (Free plan): If you prefer a CMS, use WordPress.com’s free plan ￼. It provides a site builder and hosting on a *.wordpress.com domain. (Custom HTML like above can go into a “Custom HTML” block if upgraded, but on free plan you’d use themes and the block editor.) Beware it shows WordPress ads and branding on free.
	•	Other options: Free tier of Google Firebase Hosting or Surge.sh can also host static sites at no cost.

Steps summary: Sign up for GitHub (free), create a new repository yourname.github.io, commit your HTML/CSS/images. In the repo’s Settings > Pages, select the main branch – your site is live immediately. Or sign up at Netlify, link your repo, and deploy. All these are fully free services with no hidden charges (even free SSL and CDN).

Tools used: GitHub (Pages) ￼, Netlify, Vercel, Cloudflare Pages, WordPress.com free ￼.

4. Scaling Toward $150K/Year

This model is designed for high margins and multiple revenue streams, making $150K/yr attainable:
	•	Digital products (ebooks/workout plans): Once created, selling eBooks on Gumroad (10% fee) or as PDF downloads yields near-100% margins. For example, 1,500 copies at $20 each is $30K. Upsell higher-priced courses or subscriptions for more income.
	•	Coaching calls/programs: Charge premium rates for one-on-one or small-group coaching. E.g. 50 clients at $2,000/year average = $100K. Offer packages (3-month, 6-month) to lock in revenue.
	•	Affiliate commissions: Recommend fitness gear/supplements on your site and social media. Even small commissions add up (e.g. Amazon Associates, CJ/Affiliate programs). Listings in the “Recommended Gear” section earn passive income ￼.
	•	Advertising/sponsorships: Once traffic grows, ad networks or brand sponsors (gear companies) can contribute.
	•	Email marketing & funnels: Use free email tools (MailerLite, Brevo) to build a large subscriber list. Regularly promote new products and offers to this audience. (Zapier notes many free email tools handle thousands of contacts ￼ ￼.) Automated funnels ensure repeat sales.
	•	Content marketing (social media): Post workout tips and success stories on YouTube, TikTok, Instagram to drive traffic. Use Canva to create viral graphics and video (all free) ￼. Each free tool above (YouTube, TikTok, MailerLite, Google Analytics, etc.) helps grow and retain an audience without extra cost.
	•	Analytics & optimization: Use Google Analytics/Tag Manager (free) to track visitors and conversions. Split-test headlines or pricing (with free tools) to improve sales.

By combining these, you can scale revenue while keeping overhead near zero. Free tools handle everything from site hosting to marketing. For example, Zapier highlights that “full-featured email marketing apps and free ones are far from mutually exclusive” and you can manage thousands of contacts on free plans ￼ ￼. With consistent sales of high-margin products and a growing client base, reaching $150K/year is feasible.

Sources

We’ve cited recent 2024–2025 sources for each tool and claim. All listed platforms have free tiers as of 2025, and our template/code uses only those tools (e.g. Calendly scheduling ￼, Gumroad purchases ￼, etc.). This ensures the business can start and grow with zero upfront costs while supporting a $150K/yr model.
